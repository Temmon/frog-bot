# Frog-bot

Support for a shared bot for the polyamory Discord server that even people who can't really program can contribute to. 

It uses Pycord.

## To contribute to it

This is designed so that anyone can create a little function that will be turned into a slash command really easily.

Create a file with at least one function in the frogs folder. 

The first argument should be the context, for the sake of py-cord. It can have more arguments that are suppored by py-cord. Use type annotations, such as :int or :str. See frogs/add.py for an example. 

The function must return a string.

Create a variable called frogs inside the file. It should be a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary needs 3 fields: 

command: the function you want it to call

name: the name discord will use to call it

description: a description for discord.

## To setup

There's a requirements.txt for your pip. Hopefully I remembered to freeze everything I needed.

Put your bot token in a .env file under BOT_TOKEN or add BOT_TOKEN to your environment.

## To run

python main.py

It's actually pretty simple. 

## Possible problems

You have to put your list of frogs after all the functions so that you can reference them in the list.
